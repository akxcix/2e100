AI powered search

## About
was curious how ai powered search would work. worked on it around feb 11, wrote this overnight to have a general structure around search apis and 
llm providers. was able to get summarized articles using part of html. gemini started giving 500s and i was too 
tired to debug why. wrote a route for image search but never completed it and hence is not included. 

used:
- azure bing api for search results (there might be better alternatives. i already had credits so this was quickest)
- gemini (launched around the time and i wanted to try it out)

uploading just because why not. its crap code, but i need to format my mac anyway so consider it as a backup
